## UPDATE
 
The error has been fixed in OpenAPI-to-GraphQL v1.6.0.
[This](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-to-graphql/issues/237) is the corresponding issue.

## Error description

This is a demo for a possible bug in [OpenAPI-to-GraphQL](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-to-graphql).
Run it with

```
npm run demo
```

The output, for me, is as follows:

```
OpenAPI-to-GraphQL creation event error:  Cannot process schema '{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/repo"}'. Cannot identify type of schema.
```
